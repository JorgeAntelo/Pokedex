### Install Flutter
Download the flutter SDK from their official website, follow the instructions given on the page

https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows

You can verify Flutter was installed correctly with the command:

`Flutter doctor`

All fields should be positive, but it is irrelevant if `VS - Develop for windows` package or `Chrome` are not installed.

### Connect a device
The quickest and easiest way to connect a device for testing and debugging is using a smartphone.

On the settings, you must enable the developer mode and then enable USB debugging.

Once that's done, plug the phone to the PC with a USB cable, and make sure the device is recognized by entering `flutter devices` on the console.

If the device shows up on the console, it should be visible on VS Code's bottom bar in a small label to the right side.

You can find more detailed explanations and alternatives here:
